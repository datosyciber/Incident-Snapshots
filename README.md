# Threat Hunting Snapshots & MITRE ATT&CK Mapping 

_Intelligence snapshots, investigation templates, and KQL-driven analysis workflows._ 

This repository contains a collection of **threat‑hunting snapshots**, **MITRE ATT&CK mappings**, and **incident investigation templates** designed to support cybersecurity analysts during detection, triage, and reporting activities. The goal is to provide **structured, reusable, and scalable documentation** for investigations performed using **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** across simulated or real enterprise environments.

## Objectives
- Map adversary behavior to the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework
- Document incidents using **standardized, repeatable formats**
- Provide **KQL queries** for threat hunting and detection
- Offer **intelligence snapshots** summarizing attacker activity
- Facilitate learning and practice for SOC, DFIR, and CTI workflows
